= Adorn Helper Program and Friends

This project is an experiment in testing the feasibility of providing additional functionality to various Clojure-supporting editors without adding to existing Clojure tooling (e.g. Cider, Chlorine, Calva, etc.) and further provide a path for such existing tooling to spin out some of their functionality.

Note that the primary purpose of this repository is a demonstration of HOW some functionality might be provided and not necessarily WHAT.

== Rationale

Some existing Clojure-supporting editor tooling seem to struggle with accumulating additional features.  On the one hand it's convenient to have many features built-in, on the other hand, this can make maintenance, extension, and learning of the existing code bases increasingly difficult as more functionality is added over time.

Recent developments such as https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/[GraalVM Native Image], https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo[Lumo], and https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/295[jaotc] might offer the possibility of providing quick-to-launch external programs that can provide some Clojure-related manipulation independent of other tooling.

In the Clojure spirit of Ã  la carte and decomplecting, perhaps it's practical for some functionality (e.g. some types of refactoring) to live separated from other functionality (e.g. jump-to-defintion based on static analysis).  (Note that REPL-dependent functionality is not currently being considered.)

== Architecture

The basic idea is to implement most of the desired functionality in an external Clojure program, called a "helper", and then have a thin wrapper (per supported editor) that communicates with this helper.

This should enable simpler editor-specific implementations, allow the external Clojure program to manipulate and execute Clojure code, as well as reduce the amount of code one might otherwise need to reimplement within each editor-specific implementation.

== Prerequisites

* Some Java (using >= 8 here)
* https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/#install-native-image[Native Image] (implies appropriate https://github.com/oracle/graal[GraalVM] >= 19)
* Clojure 1.9 and its clj tool
* Atom, Emacs, or VSCode

== Building and Setup

* Clone this repository and cd to the clone

* Ensure native-image is on your PATH -OR- +
  Set GRAALVM_HOME appropriately (e.g. on Arch Linux this might be /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-graal)

* Build the helper: `clj -A:native-image`.  After some time, this should produce a file named "adorn" in the current directory.

* Examine the atom / emacs / vscode subdirectory and follow the contained instructions for getting the Atom plugin / Emacs package / VSCode extension to work

== Technical Details

Initially, the helper will be created using Native Image.  Note that Native Image appears to have a variety of https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md[limitations] so it might be worth trying Lumo and/or jaotc at some point.

Communication between a wrapper and the helper could be done in a variety of ways, but the initial choice is to talk via STDIN / STDOUT and exchange JSON RPC strings.  (EDN was also considered, but support for generating it appeared to be weak in at least one commonly used editor.)

The first editors chosen for support are Atom, Emacs, and VSCode.  (It should be fairly straight-forward to create a wrapper for any editor that can read / write JSON and work with external processes.)
