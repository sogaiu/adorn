= Adorn Atom Plugin

== Prerequisites

* Adorn command line program built
* Atom
* npm
* A sacrificial / backed-up Clojure project directory

== Building

* In some terminal:

----
# install dependencies
npm install
# build + watch for changes
npx shadow-cljs watch dev
----

If all went well, there should now be a fresh file at lib/main.js (the "compiled" plugin).

* In the bin subdirectory, make a copy of the adorn binary, or create a symlink to it.

== Starting

* Symlink the directory containing this file under ~/.atom/packages/

* Start Atom

* Open a folder that has at least one Clojure file in it.

== Invoking

* Open a Clojure file in an editor pane and move the cursor to somewhere within a defn form.

* Bring up the https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#command-palette[command palette], look for / start typing "Inline Def", and once found / selected, press Enter / Return.

* This should result in an https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2017/05/25/inline-def-debugging/[Inline Def] transformation being applied to the defn.
