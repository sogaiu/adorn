= Adorn Emacs Package

== Prerequisites

* Adorn command line program built
* Emacs (>= 25.2)
* A sacrificial / backed-up Clojure file

== Setup

* Put the directory containing this file somewhere so that the contained adorn.el file ends up on your load-path.

* In the bin subdirectory, make a copy of the adorn binary, or create a symlink to it.

* In your equivalent of .emacs, add `(require 'adorn)`.

Note that it's important for adorn.el and the bin subdirectory (with its content) to end up in the same directory.

== Starting

* Start Emacs

* Open a Clojure file with at least one defn or defn- in it.

== Invoking

* Move point to somewhere within a defn or defn- form.

* M-x adorn-inline-def <RET>

* This should result in an https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2017/05/25/inline-def-debugging/[Inline Def] transformation being applied to the defn.
